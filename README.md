# **Seismic Detection Across the Solar System**  
*Nasa SpaceApps Challenge 2024* | ðŸ¥‰Achieved 3rd place out of 23 teams for the local Sfax eventðŸ¥‰ 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a **machine learning model** integrated with a **user-friendly web application** to detect seismic events in planetary data. Specifically, we worked with [seismic data](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/challenges/seismic-detection-across-the-solar-system/?tab=resources) from NASA's **Apollo missions** and the **InSight Lander** to tackle the challenge of identifying seismic signals in noisy datasets. Our goal is to improve the accuracy of seismic event detection on other planets while optimizing data transmission.

## Features
- Upload `.mseed` seismic data files.
- View file metadata and visualize seismic waveforms in an interactive plot.
- Predict and classify seismic events using a machine learning model.
- Interactive threshold controls for fine-tuned seismic detection and noise reduction using the STA/LTA algorithm.

## Machine Learning Techniques
Our application leverages **machine learning models** to classify seismic events and filter noise. The model is selected based on the best **F1 score** and utilizes **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to handle class imbalance in seismic event data.  
Key features include:
- **Seismic Event Prediction**: Identify and classify seismic events.
- **Event Timing**: Pinpoint the start time of detected events to enhance analysis.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core language.
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Streamlit for web app and data processing.
- **Machine Learning**: Model training and evaluation for seismic event classification.

## Visit our app!
OUr app is hosted on the cloud. You can visit it following this [Link1](https://astroai.streamlit.app/) or following this other [Link2](https://seismic-detection.onrender.com/)
Explore our app by uploading your own `.mseed` files or using the provided example. The app will allow you to view metadata, visualize waveforms, and identify seismic events.
